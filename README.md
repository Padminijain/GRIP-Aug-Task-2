# GRIP-Aug-Task-2- Prediction using Unsupervised ML- Iris Dataset
## Dataset: https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

## Problem statement-
From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

## Details-
The dataset is having the numeric details of petal lenght, petal widht, sepal lenght and sepal width of 3 species of Iris flower. These 3 species are- Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica
1. The dataset was loaded and then details were seen like rows, columns, null values, mean, median, etc.
2. The 'Id' column was then removed as it is having no value.
3. Then the visualization was done using pairplot and heatmap.
4. The data was splitted into dependendt and independednt variables.
5. Lastly the KMean model building was done to get the optimum number of clusters and presented it using scatter plot.

## Conclusion- Number of cluster = 3 is the optimum.
